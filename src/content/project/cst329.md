In this course students learn to develop skill in using logic to describe and assess arguments.
Students will learn to write formulas in propositional and first-order logic, and more importantly,
to write and check proofs. Students will also learn to write formulas in three-valued and modal logic,
know how to choose an appropriate logic, and understand the limitations of logic in capturing human
reasoning.

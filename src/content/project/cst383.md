In data science, data analysis and machine learning techniques are applied to visualize data,
understand trends, and make predictions. In this course students will learn how to obtain data,
preprocess it, apply machine learning methods, and visualize the results. A student who completes
the course will have enough theoretical knowledge, and enough skill with modern statistical
programming languages and their libraries, to define and perform complete data science projects.

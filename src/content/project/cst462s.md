Provides students with key knowledge of race, gender, class and social justice especially in relation
to technology in todayâ€™s digital world. Students challenge the barriers of expertise, gender, race,
class, and location that restrict wider access to and understanding of the production and usage of
new technologies. Students will engage in a practical experience in the community via their service
placements, which will provide depth and context for considering questions of justice, equality,
social responsibilities and the complexities of technology and its societal impact. The course uses
scenario based approach combining presentations, discussions, and reflections to allow students
explore the relationship between critical reflection and action on the topics mentioned above.
